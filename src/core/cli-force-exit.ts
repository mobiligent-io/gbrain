/**
 * v0.41.8.0 — narrow force-exit gate for the cli.ts op-dispatch finally.
 *
 * The cli.ts caller fires `process.exit(0)` ONLY when:
 *   1. The op-dispatch drain timed out (drainResult.outcome === 'timeout')
 *   2. AND this function returns true (i.e. the command is NOT a daemon)
 *
 * The function lives in its own module — not inline in cli.ts — so tests
 * can import + drive it without triggering cli.ts's top-level main() side
 * effect (cli.ts is a script entrypoint). Mirrors PR #1337's
 * `shouldForceExitAfterMain` guard, but narrower in scope: this wave
 * only force-exits after the drain timed out, NOT unconditionally for
 * every non-serve command.
 *
 * Daemon list is just `serve` (stdio + HTTP): it RETURNS from its handler
 * while the event loop carries the server. Every other long-runner —
 * `jobs work`, `autopilot`, and v0.43's `gbrain watch` (#2095) — BLOCKS
 * inside its awaited handler until done (watch blocks in the stdin
 * iteration: interactive stays alive until Ctrl-C/Ctrl-D, piped input ends
 * at EOF), so when main() resolves the work is over and the deliberate
 * flush-exit is correct. Add a command here ONLY if it returns early and
 * leaves the event loop holding the daemon.

/**
 * v0.43 (#2084) — deliberate exit after bounded teardown.
 *
 * Lingering sockets (embedding-provider fetch keep-alive, PgBouncer txn-mode
 * sockets `endPoolBounded` raced past) keep Bun's event loop alive after
 * teardown RESOLVES, so the CLI used to ride the 10s hard-deadline backstop
 * on every `gbrain query`. The fix is to exit on purpose the moment main()
 * resolves — but only after stdout/stderr have actually drained: incident
 * #1959 (see src/core/db.ts) was a force-exit truncating piped stdout
 * mid-payload.
 *
 * Flush contract: a stream is drained when `writableLength === 0` — bytes
 * queued in the JS-side buffer are the only ones `process.exit()` can lose
 * (the kernel owns anything already written to the fd). `writableNeedDrain`
 * is NOT sufficient (it only says "below high-water mark"). We wake on
 * 'drain' when it fires, and poll on a short tick because 'drain' is only
 * emitted after a write() returned false — a small queued chunk can flush
 * without ever signalling. A blocked pipe (reader stopped consuming) is
 * bounded by `guardMs`: partial output to a stalled reader is unavoidable,
 * hanging the process is not.
